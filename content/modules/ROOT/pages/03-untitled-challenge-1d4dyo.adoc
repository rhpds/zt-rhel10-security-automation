== Background

In this lab, your manager Scott says there are is a web developer that
is starting today.

His name is David J. and he will need a dedicated account, for awith
special sudo permissions to start and stop the httpd service and the
ability to host the website from his home directory.

David’s account "`Davidj`" has been made, and he has created some of the
needed files, but something is not working.

Let’s start by switching user from root to '`davidj`' and the password
"`redhat`" and test to see what permissions are working.

[source,bash,run]
----
su - davidj
----

next we want to see what the status of httpd is

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo systemctl status httpd
----

[source,bash,run]
----
redhat
----

Now lets see if he has permission to change the status service,

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo systemctl start httpd
----

[source,bash,run]
----
redhat
----

So the account doesn;’t currently have the access to spin up and spin
down the httpd service. To help change that we are going to use the new
Sudo System-Role.

Now lets close out of the davidj user and go back to our root user.

[source,bash,run]
----
exit
----

== Ansible Playbook Explanation

Now we will run create the sudo rule to add him to the sudoers to run a
couple of commands using the sudo system rules.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat webdev.yml
----

== Ansible Playbook Explanation

=== What is Ansible?

Ansible is like a set of instructions that a computer can follow to do
tasks automatically. It’s used to manage and configure servers.

=== What Does This Playbook Do?

==== Hosts: localhost

This means the playbook will run on the same computer where it is
executed. Think of it as telling the computer to do something to itself.

==== Vars: (Variables)

These are like settings or options that the playbook uses. In this case,
it’s setting up some rules for a special file called `+sudoers+`.

==== sudo_sudoers_files:

This is a list of files that will be created or modified to give certain
users special permissions.

* *path: /etc/sudoers.d/webdev*
** This is the location where the file will be created.
* *user_specifications:*
** This part tells Ansible who can do what.
** *users:*
*** *davidj*
*** *%webdev*
**** These are the users who will get special permissions. `+%webdev+`
means any user who is part of the `+webdev+` group.
** *hosts: ALL*
*** This means these permissions apply to all computers.
** *operators: ALL*
*** This means any command can be run.
** *commands:*
*** */usr/bin/systemctl start httpd*
*** */usr/bin/systemctl stop httpd*
*** */usr/bin/systemctl status httpd*
**** These are the specific commands that the users can run. They are
commands to start, stop, and check the status of a web server called
`+httpd+`.

==== Roles:

This is like a pre-made set of instructions that Ansible can use.

* *role: rhel-system-roles.sudo*
** This role is specifically for managing `+sudo+` permissions on Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems.

=== What Happens When This Playbook Runs?

* The playbook will create a file at `+/etc/sudoers.d/webdev+`.
* This file will give the user `+davidj+` and any user in the `+webdev+`
group the ability to run specific commands related to the `+httpd+` web
server on any computer.
* The commands they can run are to start, stop, and check the status of
the `+httpd+` web server.

So, in simple terms, this playbook sets up special permissions for
certain users to control a web server on their computer.

Now run the playbook again to apply the system roles to the clients
group.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini  webdev.yml
----

Lets log back into David’s account

[source,bash,run]
----
su - davidj
----

next we want to see what the status of httpd is

Now lets see if he has permission to change the status service,

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo systemctl start httpd
----

Use this as davidj’s password.

[source,bash,run]
----
redhat
----

Once we have started the service, lets make sure it’s running.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo systemctl status httpd
----

Lets head to the next section.
