computers called "`targets`" and run a set of instructions to install
and set up the AIDE software. AIDE is a tool that helps keep track of
changes to files on your computer, which can be useful for security and
monitoring purposes.

=== Lets Run It!

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini aide.yml
----

Ok now that we have a baseline, we can check to see what the aide log
looks like.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo cat /var/log/aide/aide.log
----

Now lets install a new program.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo yum install -y vim
----

Now lets see what aide tracked

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo aide --check
----

This will take 45 to 90 seconds to scan.
